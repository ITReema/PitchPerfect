# Pitch Perfect
This app records a conversation between you and a friend, and then alters your voices to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader.

## Implementation

**The app has two view controller scenes:**

* RecordSoundsViewController - consists a record button with a microphone image. Tapping this microphone button starts an audio recording session and present a stop button. When the stop button is clicked, the app completes recording and then show the PlaySound controller.

* PlaySoundsViewController - contains six buttons to play the recorded sound file with different effects and a button to stop the playback.

The application uses code from AVFoundation to record sounds from the microphone (AVAudioRecorder) and play recorded audio with effects (AVAudioPlayer, AVAudioEngine).
